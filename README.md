## Abstract

Organizations should focus on effective knowledge management to improve their competitiveness.  The number of applications being developed that require access to knowledge about the real world has increased rapidly over the past two decades. Domain ontologies formalize the terms being used in each discipline. They have become essential components for research in areas such as machine learning, the internet of things, robotics, and natural language processing because they enable separate systems to exchange information.

Inspections are critical processes for the control and reduction of accidents in mining. The inspection process describes the updated status of a mining facility through findings -and their probable causes- verified during the inspection of a mining facility.

One of the biggest challenges in registering knowledge during the mining inspection process is the design of a formal model for its representation, which in turn can contain important data to support decision-making in the event of a possible accident. One of the biggest challenges in processing knowledge is the design of a formal model for its representation. Because traditional information systems are inadequate for this purpose, it is necessary to employ alternative approaches such as those based on ontologies. Ontologies are built to store and process knowledge about objects and dependencies between them.  Concepts, relations, and restrictions in the ontology help to provide elements that support decision making for the prevention of mining accidents. Therefore, ontology represents the knowledge base in the area of mining inspection.

This work presents an ontology for the mining inspections. This domain ontology defines the semantics, i.e., the meaning of the key entities, and represents the knowledge about mining inspection in a machine-friendly way. The Inspection Ontology describes the concept, relations, and rules carried out to verify the safety conditions in the mines. As a study case, we process the knowledge elucidated from interviews with the Chilean National Service for Geology and Mining (SERNAGEOMIN, after *Servicio Nacional de Geología y Minería*, its name in Spanish) that is the government body in charge of mining safety monitoring and control in Chile.
